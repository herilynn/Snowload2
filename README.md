# "Snowload2" (original Snowload file was messed up) is a timer countdown until the upcoming 2024 New Years!

# Functionality:
-currently there's a countdown that reflects the Eastern time zone (will hopefully be able to add an option to jump between different time zones)
-animated loading symbols to represent snowflakes 
-animated canvas/background to emulate the Aurora Borealis (couldn't get the exact pattern/colors)
-working audio on loop with on/off button
-loading snowball on the bottom that shows the progress throughout the day (still needs it to display a trail and rotating effect as well as a character pushing it) Currently the snowball just gets larger throughout the day and resets back to the left side of the screen at midnight at its original size.

# tech/libs/apis: canvas, JS, CSS, webpack

# Future Implementations
-add a way to toggle between time zones with the snowball loading at the bottom and time left reflecting as such
-loading snowflakes turning into a animated check marks (representing fireworks) on New Years
-getting audio to play without needing to click on the Sound button at all in the beginning
-snowball on the bottom leaving a trail to emulate a loading bar more
-snowball rotating for better visual effect
-getting elf sprite to animate behind the snowball to look like it's pushing the snowball
